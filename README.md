# UniMatch – The Smart Partner for Academic Projects

Find your ideal teammates for academic projects, fast and smart.

UniMatch is a student-focused platform that helps university and college students form effective, compatible, and balanced project teams based on skills, work style, availability, and collaboration preferences.

Random groupings and unbalanced workloads are common problems in academic teamwork. UniMatch introduces structure, compatibility, and clarity into the team formation process.

## What is UniMatch?

UniMatch is an intelligent matchmaking system designed specifically for academic group projects.  
It connects students who work well together, rather than grouping them arbitrarily.

By combining personal work profiles, preferences, and optional collaboration feedback, UniMatch supports the creation of teams that are more productive, balanced, and reliable.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Work Profile Creation
Each student creates a profile that captures how they work, not only what they know.

Profile attributes include:
- Working style (e.g., early bird, night owl)
- Core strengths (coding, writing, presenting, research, design)
- Preferred role in group work (leader, contributor, planner, executor)
- Availability and deadlines
- Course and project type

---

### 2. Smart Matching Algorithm
UniMatch applies compatibility-based matching logic that:
- Matches complementary skill sets
- Prioritizes compatible working styles
- Reduces overlap of weaknesses within teams
- Optionally incorporates feedback from past collaborations

The goal is to optimize collaboration quality, not popularity.

---

### 3. Match and Collaborate
The interaction model is inspired by modern matchmaking interfaces, adapted for academic collaboration.

Users can:
- Browse suggested teammates through structured work profiles
- View strengths, roles, and collaboration history
- Match with individuals or join existing groups
- Initiate communication once a match is formed

---

## Key Features

- Skill- and role-based teammate matching
- Post-project feedback and collaboration reviews

## Target Users

## Motivation and Impact

Many academic projects fail not due to lack of ability, but due to poor team compatibility and unclear expectations.

UniMatch addresses common issues such as:
- Uneven workload distribution
- Communication breakdowns
- Last-minute coordination problems
- Repeated negative teamwork experiences

By introducing transparency and data-informed matching, UniMatch aims to improve both academic performance and the student collaboration experience.
